🐂🐄 Bulls and Cows Game

This is my Python implementation of the classic Bulls and Cows logic game.
single player vs. AI🤖
two-player vs. your friend👥

After each guess, the game provides feedback:

Bulls 🐂 → Correct digit in the correct position.
Cows 🐄 → Correct digit, but in the wrong position.

The project includes a Tkinter-based GUI for easy and interactive play.
When you first play, your name is registered in a .csv file and later remembered!
